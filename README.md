# data-entry-job-automation
This is my mini-project, created while going through the 100 Days of Code Python Course. This is a program that does web-scraping from static page to gather some data (BeautifulSoup) and then uses this data to send answers to Google form (currently disabled) using browser automation technology such as Selenium.
